# Private Prediction and Training of Logistic Regression Model

The examples are as follows:

- [`prediction-single.py`](./prediction-single.py) shows how a single client can run a private prediction
- [`prediction-joint.py`](./prediction-joint.py) shows how several clients can combine features for a prediction
- [`training-single.py`](./training-single.py) shows how a model can be privately trained on data from a single owner
- [`training-joint.py`](./training-joint.py) shows how several data owners can jointly train on their combined data
