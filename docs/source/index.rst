tf-encrypted
========================================

tf-encrypted is an open source Python library built on top of `TensorFlow`_ focused on making it easy for researchers and practitioners to experiment with privacy-preserving machine learning without needing to be an expert in machine learning, cryptography, distributed systems, or high performance computing.

More detailed information on the architecture, performance, and security considerations of this project are contained in `Private Machine Learning in TensorFlow using Secure Computation`_ paper which introduced this project.

- **Simple**: It should be easy to get started, experiment with, use, benchmark, and deeply integrate with pre-existing data science workflows.
- **Extensible**: Extending tf-encrypted to experiment with new protocols, tensor implementations, and machine learning algorithms should be a first class citizen.
- **Performant**: All of the fastest known implementations of protocols, tensor implementations, and machine learning algorithms in a private setting should exist within this library.
- **Secure**: A user should have to go out of their way to use the library in a non-secure, non-private fashion. New protocols are marked as experimental until they've met our high bar of security.
- **Community-Driven**: Community-first as a decision making framework. We can only achieve these goals by building a community of researchers, contributors, and users around the project.
