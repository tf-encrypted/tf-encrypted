## Introduction to TensorFlow Encrypted API

tf-encrypted has a simple api to make it easy for data scientists to make private predictions and trainings.


To define a machine learning model, tf-encrypted and TensorFlow follow a very similar API.

layer1 = prot.sigmoid(layer0)

layer1 = prot.sigmoid(layer0)
layer2 = prot.dot(layer, w1) + b1
prediction = layer2</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

To make private predictions and trainings, we have to define a ModelTrainer and a PredictionClient. The ModelTrainer is responsible for training the model, and then provides the encrypted weights. The PredictionClient will provide the private input that will be used to make a private prediction.


```python
model_trainer = ModelTrainer(config.get_player('model-trainer'))
prediction_client = PredictionClient(config.get_player('prediction-client'))
```

We indicate tf-encrypted to perform secure computation with the Pond protocol as follows:

```python
with tfe.protocol.Pond(server0, server1, crypto_producer) as prot:
```

Finally we can make a prediction as follows:
```python
with tfe.protocol.Pond(server0, server1, crypto_producer) as prot:

  # get model parameters as private tensors from model owner
  w0, b0, w1, b1 = prot.define_private_input(model_trainer, masked=True)

  # get prediction input from client
  x = prot.define_private_input(prediction_client, masked=True)

  # compute prediction
  layer0 = prot.dot(x, w0) + b0
  layer1 = prot.sigmoid(layer0)
  layer2 = prot.dot(layer, w1) + b1
  prediction = layer2

  # send prediction output back to client
  prediction_op = prot.define_output(prediction, prediction_client)
```

Two servers and a crypto producer are doing the actual computation on encrypted data, with only the client being able to decrypt the final result.




## Making Private Predictions
### a. Locally

With Tensorflow Encrypted, you can very easily make private predictions with a pre-trained model saved as a [protobuf](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/tool_developers/) file.

1. In the [`examples/`](./examples/) folder run the following line of code in your terminal to train a convolution network on MNIST dataset, then save the model as a protobuf file :
```bash
python3 mnist_deep_cnn.py
```
If you prefer to skip this step, we have saved the trained model `mnist_model.pb` in [`examples/test_data/`](./examples/test_data/).

2. Make private prediction on an MNIST input by running the following code snippet:
```bash
../bin/run test_data/mnist_model.pb test_data/mnist_input.npy
```

You have just made a prediction without revealing anything about the input!

### b. GCP

**NOTE** It would be great to have an example as above with GCP where we import a protobuf file and run a prediction.

You can make private predictions with GCP as well. You can find a great example [here](https://github.com/mortendahl/tf-encrypted/tree/master/examples/mnist#remotely-on-gcp).

## Making Private Trainings

**NOTE** We currently don't have an example. We are planning to train/create a simple logistic regression as a demo..
