# TF Encrypted

TF Encrypted is a Python library built on top of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) for researchers and practitioners to experiment with privacy-preserving machine learning. It provides an interface similar to that of TensorFlow, and aims at making the technology readily available without first becoming an expert in machine learning, cryptography, distributed systems, and high performance computing.

In particular, the library focuses on:

- **Usability**: The API and its underlying design philosophy make it easy to get started, use, and integrate privacy-preserving technology into pre-existing machine learning processes.
- **Extensibility**: The architecture supports and encourages experimentation and benchmarking of new cryptographic protocols and machine learning algorithms.
- **Performance**: Optimizing for tensor-based applications and relying on TensorFlow's backend means runtime performance comparable to that of specialized stand-alone frameworks.
- **Community**: With a primary goal of pushing the technology forward the project encourages collaboration and open source over proprietary and closed solutions.
- **Security**: Cryptographic protocols are evaluated against strong notions of security and [known limitations](#known-limitations) are highlighted.

# Installation

TF Encrypted is available as a package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tf-encrypted/) supporting Python 3.5+ and TensorFlow 1.12.0+ which can be installed using:

```bash
pip3 install tf-encrypted
```

Alternatively, installing from source can be done using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted.git
cd tf-encrypted
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -e .
```

This latter is useful on platforms for which the pip package has not yet been compiled but is also needed for [development](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). Note that this will get you a working basic installation, yet a few more steps are required to match the performance and security of the version shipped in the pip package, see the [installation instructions](./docs/INSTALL.md).

## Custom build of TensorFlow For 1.12.0

TF Encrypted officially supports TensorFlow 1.13.1 but if you have a need to run on 1.12.0 and want to take advantage of the int64 tensor speed improvements you'll have to make use of a custom build.

Such builds are available for [macOS](https://storage.googleapis.com/dropoutlabs-tensorflow-builds/tensorflow-1.12.0-cp35-cp35m-macosx_10_7_x86_64.whl) and [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/dropoutlabs-tensorflow-builds/tensorflow-1.12.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl) as a temporary solution until the next official release of TensorFlow is out (version 1.13), but no guarantees are made about them and they should be treated as pre-alpha. See more in the [installation instructions](./docs/INSTALL.md#custom-tensorflow).

# Usage

The following is an example of simple matmul on encrypted data using TF Encrypted:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tf_encrypted as tfe

def provide_input():
    # normal TensorFlow operations can be run locally
    # as part of defining a private input, in this
    # case on the machine of the input provider
    return tf.ones(shape=(5, 10))

# define inputs
w = tfe.define_private_variable(tf.ones(shape=(10,10)))
x = tfe.define_private_input('input-provider', provide_input)

# define computation
y = tfe.matmul(x, w)

with tfe.Session() as sess:
    # initialize variables
    sess.run(tfe.global_variables_initializer())
    # reveal result
    result = sess.run(y.reveal())
```

For more information, check out the [documentation](./docs/) or the [examples](./examples/).

# Roadmap

- High-level APIs for combining privacy and machine learning. So far TF Encrypted is focused on its low-level interface but it's time to figure out what it means for interfaces such as Keras when privacy enters the picture.

- Tighter integration with TensorFlow. This includes aligning with the upcoming TensorFlow 2.0 as well as figuring out how TF Encrypted can work closely together with related projects such as [TF Privacy](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy) and [TF Federated](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated).

- Support for third party libraries. While TF Encrypted has its own implementations of secure computation, there are other [excellent libraries](https://github.com/rdragos/awesome-mpc/) out there for both secure computation and homomorphic encryption. We want to bring these on board and provide a bridge from TensorFlow.

# Background & Further Reading

The following texts provide further in-depth presentations of the project:

- [Growing TF Encrypted](https://medium.com/dropoutlabs/growing-tf-encrypted-a1cb7b109ab5) outlines the roadmap and motivates why TF Encrypted is a community project
- [Experimenting with TF Encrypted](https://medium.com/dropoutlabs/experimenting-with-tf-encrypted-fe37977ff03c) walks through a simple example of turning an existing TensorFlow prediction model private
- [Private Machine Learning in TensorFlow using Secure Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08130) further elaborates on the benefits of the approach, outlines the adaptation of a secure computation protocol, and reports on concrete performance numbers
- [Secure Computations as Dataflow Programs](https://mortendahl.github.io/2018/03/01/secure-computation-as-dataflow-programs/) describes the initial motivation and implementation

# Project Status

TF Encrypted is experimental software not currently intended for use in production environments. The focus is on building the underlying primitives and techniques, with some practical security issues postponed for a later stage. However, care is taken to ensure that none of these represent fundamental issues that cannot be fixed as needed.

## Known limitations

- Elements of TensorFlow's networking subsystem does not appear to be sufficiently hardened against malicious users. Proxies or other means of access filtering may be sufficient to mitigate this.
